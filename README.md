A decentralized crop insurance platform leveraging **Chainlink Price Feeds**, **Chainlink Automation**, and **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** to provide transparent, automated, and verifiable agricultural insurance.

## 🌾 Overview

This platform provides parametric crop insurance that automatically pays out when drought conditions are detected. The system integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies to create a trustless, transparent, and efficient insurance solution for farmers.

### Key Features

- **🔗 Multi-Token Support**: Accept premiums in ETH, USDC, DAI, and USDT using Chainlink Price Feeds
- **🤖 Automated Monitoring**: Chainlink Automation for daily weather monitoring without manual intervention
- **🛡️ EAS Integration**: Ethereum Attestation Service for immutable, verifiable insurance records
- **☔ Multi-Source Weather Data**: Weather monitoring from multiple oracle sources for enhanced reliability
- **⚡ Gas Optimized**: Batch processing and optimized contracts for cost-effective operations
- **🔒 Security First**: Comprehensive access controls, reentrancy protection, and emergency mechanisms

## 📊 Gas Optimization Targets

| Operation | Target Gas | Max Gas |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Contract Creation | < 2.5M | 3M |
| Premium Payment | < 150k | 200k |
| Single Upkeep | < 400k | 500k |
| Batch Upkeep (10) | < 1.5M | 2M |
| Weather Check | < 250k | 300k |

## 🔧 Key Components
